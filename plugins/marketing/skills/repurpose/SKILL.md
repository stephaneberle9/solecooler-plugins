name: repurpose
description: "Turn a single piece of content into platform-native posts for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Use when someone has a blog post, newsletter, podcast, video transcript, or article and wants to multiply it across channels — not lazy cross-posting, but posts built for each platform from scratch. Triggers on: repurpose this, split this into posts, multiply this content, distribute this, atomize this, make social posts from this, turn this into a thread, create posts from this, publish this across channels. Use this skill even when the user doesn't say 'repurpose' — if they have a source piece of content and want multiple channel-specific outputs, this is the right tool. Reads brand voice and ICP from CLAUDE.md before writing. Delivers channel-ready content you can publish immediately."

# Repurpose Workshop

Write once. Publish ten times. The creators who win don't produce more — they distribute smarter.

This skill takes any source material and turns it into channel-native posts. Not lazy cross-posting. Posts that feel like they were built for each platform from scratch.

**The multiplier effect:** One newsletter becomes 1 LinkedIn slide deck + 2 LinkedIn written posts + 1 X thread + 3 standalone tweets + 2 Instagram slide decks + 1 Reel script + 2 TikTok scripts + 1 YouTube Short script = 13 pieces from a single source.

---

## the core job

Turn source material into **channel-native posts** that:
- Align with each channel's ranking signals so your content gets shown to more people
- Follow format-specific structures (native content outperforms cross-posts by 40-60%)
- Open with tested scroll-stoppers (the first line or second determines everything)
- Feel built for that channel (audiences can smell repurposed content)

**Output:** Channel-ready posts (5-15 pieces depending on source richness), each formatted for its destination and ready to paste.

---

## before starting: gather context

**STOP. Do not write any posts until context is in hand. Cap questions at 2 max.**

**Load reference skills first:**
- `company-instructions` — Solecooler voice rules, writing standards, and banned phrases that apply to all output.

### Step A: Gather context (fast)

1. **Check what's already loaded.** In Cowork, context comes from three layers: `company-instructions` (company-wide voice rules — loaded above), Global Instructions (the user's personal overlay from `/personal-interview`), and project-specific context — Project Instructions in Claude Desktop, or CLAUDE.md for CLI users. Scan for:
   - **Voice** — tone, do/don't rules, signature phrases. Every channel's output has to sound like the user.
   - **ICP** — who the audience is, where they hang out (which channels matter most for THIS audience).
   - **CTA / business** — any newsletter, product, or free resource that channel posts should link to.
2. **Last resort:** check the project folder for `Context/voice.md`, `Context/icp.md`, `Context/business.md`. Read whichever exist.
3. **If voice is still missing:** flag it — "I'll write in neutral direct tone. Paste 3-5 sentences in your voice, or a link to your style, for a closer match."

### Step B: Confirm the brief (≤2 questions, combined)

Skip anything context already covers. Combine into at most 2 questions:

1. **Source + channels** — "What's the source material (paste it or drop a URL), and which channels do you want to hit — LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or all of them?"
2. **Priority piece (only if ambiguous)** — "Any specific channel you want me to optimize for first? Or do I rank by best-fit for your source?"

Never more than 2. If ICP context already names the primary channel, skip Q2.

---

## the process

```
MINE → MATCH → MOLD → SCHEDULE
```

Four stages. Each one builds on the last. Don't skip.

---

## Stage 1 — Mine the source

Pull seven elements from the source material. These are the raw building blocks for every channel piece.

| Element | What to Look For |
|---------|------------------|
| Central takeaway | The single idea someone should walk away with |
| Building blocks | 3-7 sub-points that support the central takeaway |
| Concrete illustrations | Stories, examples, anecdotes that bring points to life |
| Proof points | Numbers, stats, results that back up claims |
| Unexpected angles | Opinions that push back on conventional thinking |
| Next steps | What someone can actually do with this information |
| Standalone lines | Sharp phrases that work on their own without context |

**High-yield sources** (10+ pieces possible): blog posts, newsletters, podcast episodes, long videos, webinars, case studies.
**Medium-yield sources** (5-8 pieces): data/research, processes/frameworks.

---

## Stage 2 — Match to channels

Pair each element with its strongest channel and format:

- **Central takeaway** → headlines for single posts on every channel
- **Building blocks (grouped)** → LinkedIn/Instagram slide decks, X threads
- **Individual building blocks** → standalone posts on any channel
- **Concrete illustrations** → Instagram Reels, TikToks, Stories
- **Proof points** → LinkedIn + X image posts and slide decks
- **Standalone lines** → quote graphics on X and Instagram
- **Unexpected angles** → single tweets and TikTok video hooks

---

## Stage 3 — Mold for each channel

Shape each piece for its destination. Use the channel blueprints below. For deeper patterns, algorithm details, and extended hook libraries, load [references/channel-guide.md](references/channel-guide.md) — it has per-channel deep dives.

### LinkedIn

**What the algorithm rewards (late 2025):**
- Dwell time (strongest signal) — how long someone spends reading
- Topic authority — consistent posting in one niche
- Golden hour — first 60 minutes decides reach to 2nd/3rd-degree connections
- Relevance over recency — older posts resurface if they match user interests
- No outbound links — posts without links get meaningfully more distribution

**Format guide:**
- **Slide deck:** 5-10 slides at 1080x1350px. Highest dwell time. Save magnet.
- **Written post:** 1,200-1,500 characters with a 3-line opening.
- **Document post:** PDF 10-15 pages max. Frameworks and guides shine.
- **Video:** 30-90 seconds, captions mandatory.

**Slide deck structure:** Opening slide (bold claim + "Swipe to learn X") → 2-6 content slides (1 point each, 2-3 sentences) → Recap slide (5 points in 5 words each) → Close slide ("Found this useful? Follow / Repost / Save").

**Written post structure:** Scroll-stopper → line break → 2-3 lines of context → 5 numbered points → line break → "so what" takeaway → question/CTA → 3-5 hashtags at the bottom (line break above).

**Scroll-stoppers:**
- Pushback: "Stop [thing everyone does]. It's wrecking your [result]."
- Narrative: "Last week, I [did something]. What happened next changed how I think about [topic]."
- Numbered preview: "[N] [things] that [outcome]. (Number [X] is the one nobody mentions.)"
- Authority: "After [impressive stat/experience], here's what I know for sure about [topic]:"
- Curiosity: "Why do [surprising thing happen]? I finally figured it out."
- Proof: "[Counterintuitive claim]. Here's the evidence:"

### Twitter / X

**What the algorithm rewards (late 2025):**
- Replies (especially from regulars you interact with) — top signal
- Quote tweets — 2x engagement vs plain retweet
- Time on tweet + time on linked content
- Profile visits triggered by curiosity
- Media (images, video, GIFs) get a visibility bump
- First-hour engagement is critical

**Format guide:**
- **Single tweet:** under 100 characters for highest engagement
- **Thread:** 8-15 tweets for depth + follower growth
- **Image tweet:** 1200x675px, 35% more engagement than text alone
- **Quote tweet:** add genuine value to the original

**Thread structure:** Opening tweet (bold claim + one-line learn promise + thread emoji) → 2-X body tweets (numbered headline, 2-3 sentence explanation, proof where it fits) → Closing tweet (TL;DR bullets + "If this helped: 1. Follow @handle. 2. RT tweet 1.").

**Standalone tweet formats:**
- **Observation:** "Most people think [X]. But [Y] is actually true because [Z]."
- **Rundown:** "[N] [things] that [outcome]" + bullets + "Which one hits different?"
- **Spicy take:** "Unpopular opinion:" + contrarian statement + one-line reasoning
- **Invitation:** Provocative question + "Genuine question. Reply with your take."
- **Receipt:** Result or stat + "Here's exactly how:" + 3-5 bullets

**Scroll-stoppers:**
- Obituary: "[Thing] is dead. Here's what's replacing it:"
- Receipts: "I [did X] for [time period]. Here's what happened:"
- Spicy: "This will piss off [group], but [claim]."
- Gap: "The [industry] secret no one talks about:"
- Proof: "[Specific result] in [timeframe]. No [common excuse]. Here's the playbook:"

### Instagram

**What the algorithm rewards (late 2025):**
- **DM shares ("sends per reach")** — biggest discovery signal for Reels and Explore
- Saves (very high — indicates lasting value)
- Watch time + completion for Reels
- Early velocity (first 30-90 minutes)
- Relationship signals (DMs, profile taps, comment history)

**Format guide:**
- **Slide deck:** 6-10 slides (up to 20 in some regions) at 1080x1350px
- **Reel:** 7-15 seconds for viral reach, 30-45 for tutorials
- **Single image:** 1080x1350px (getting renewed love in 2025)
- **Story:** 1080x1920px, under 15 seconds

**Slide deck structure:** Cover (bold statement, minimal design, high contrast) → Setup (why this matters or what most people get wrong) → 3-8 content slides (one point each, large text) → Optional recap (checkmark list) → Close slide ("Save for later. Follow @handle.").

**Caption structure:** Hook line (visible before "more" cutout) → three dots for spacing → 2-4 short paragraphs with the insight → divider line → save/share/comment prompts with emoji → divider line → 3 niche hashtags at bottom.

**Reel script (15-30 seconds):** 0-3s pattern interrupt or bold claim → 3-20s "Here's [what/why/how]:" + 3 brief points → 20-30s "Follow for more / Save this / Send to someone who needs this."

### TikTok

**What the algorithm rewards (late 2025):**
- First-second retention (opening seconds carry disproportionate weight)
- Rewatch rate — strong signal
- DM shares outrank public shares
- Niche community alignment beats broad virality
- Contextual categorization (humor vs education vs emotion)
- Production quality (lighting, sound, editing)

**Current state:** Longer content (30-60+ seconds) rewarded when retention holds. Niche communities (#BookTok, #MarketingTok) get boosted over generic viral attempts.

**Format guide:**
- **Quick hit:** 15-30 seconds (highest completion rates)
- **Standard:** 30-60 seconds (favored when retention holds)
- **Deep dive:** 1-3 minutes (engaged niche audiences)
- All formats: 1080x1920px (9:16) vertical

**Script structure (15-30 seconds):** Hook 0-3s (visual + verbal) → Body 3-25s ("Here's the thing:" + 3 points delivered fast) → Close 25-30s ("Follow for more" / "Part 2?" / "Save this").

**Scroll-stoppers:**
- Pattern break: unexpected visual or statement
- Identity callout: "This is for my [specific group] who [specific situation]"
- Result first: show outcome immediately, then explain the path
- Controversy spark: "I'm going to get hate for this but [take]"
- Knowledge gap: "I can't believe [industry/brand] doesn't want you to know this"
- Speed promise: "In 30 seconds I'll show you how to [specific outcome]"

### YouTube

**What the algorithm rewards (late 2025):**
- Click-through rate (CTR) from thumbnails
- Average view duration + % watched
- Session impact (keeps people on YouTube longer)
- Viewer satisfaction (surveys + behavior)
- Channel topical focus

**Format guide:**
- **Shorts:** 10-35 seconds for discovery, up to 60 seconds. Vertical 1080x1920.
- **Long-form:** 8-12 minute sweet spot for most niches.
- **Thumbnails:** 1280x720px, target 4-10% CTR from Home (6-12% is strong).

**Shorts script:** Hook 0-2s (immediate value promise or pattern interrupt) → Body 2-50s (value fast, each point 5-10 seconds max, keep moving visually) → Close 50-60s ("Subscribe for more" / "Full video on my channel" / end abruptly for rewatch).

**Long-form structure — GRABS:**
- **Grab (0-30s):** Pattern interrupt or bold claim + quick credibility + preview ("By the end of this video you'll know how to [outcome].")
- **Reveal (30s-1m):** Brief context, who this is for, what you'll cover.
- **Advance (main content):** Deliver on the promise with clear verbal signposting ("First... Second... Third...") + examples/proof per point.
- **Boost (throughout):** Every 2-3 minutes drop an engagement prompt.
- **Seal (final 30s):** Summarize key points + clear next action + end screen with subscribe button.

**Title formulas:**
- "How I [result]"
- "[N] [things] that [outcome]"
- "Why [thing] doesn't work"
- "The [adjective] [thing]"
- "I [did X] for [time]. Here's what happened"
- "[Year] guide to [topic]"

## Stage 4 — Schedule

Stagger the pieces so each one gets room to perform.

| Order | Channel + Format | Timing | Reason |
|-------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| First | LinkedIn slide deck | Day 1 | Longest shelf life |
| Second | X thread | Day 1-2 | Sparks discussion |
| Third | Instagram slide deck | Day 2-3 | Adapt LinkedIn design |
| Fourth | TikTok / Reel | Day 3-4 | Needs video production |
| Fifth | YouTube Short | Day 4-5 | Can adapt TikTok content |
| Ongoing | Standalone posts | Spread out | Mine individual points over time |

---

## channel voice calibration

Same insight, different energy per channel:

| Channel | Tone | Example delivery of the same idea |
|---------|------|-----------------------------------|
| LinkedIn | Professional, reflective | "After 10 years in marketing, I've learned that simplicity beats complexity. Here's why:" |
| X | Sharp, direct | "Hot take: Simple marketing > 'sophisticated' marketing. Every time." |
| Instagram | Visual, motivational | [Image: "Simple > Sophisticated" + story in caption] |
| TikTok | Casual, high energy | "Y'all I need to talk about why everyone's overcomplicating their marketing..." |
| YouTube | Conversational, thorough | "If you've been in marketing for any length of time, you've probably noticed something..." |

The core insight stays. The delivery changes completely. Repurposing fails when the insight ports but the energy doesn't.

---

## channel specs at a glance (late 2025)

| Channel | Best Length | Top Format | Scroll-Stop Window | Strongest Signal |
|---------|-------------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| LinkedIn | 1,200-1,500 chars | Slide deck | First 3 lines | Dwell time + topic authority |
| X | Under 100 chars (single) | Thread (8-15) | First tweet | Replies + early engagement |
| Instagram | 6-10 slides | Slide deck | First slide | DM shares (sends per reach) |
| TikTok | 30-60 sec (if retention holds) | Short video | First 3 seconds | Completion + niche alignment |
| YouTube Shorts | 10-35 seconds | Vertical video | First 2 seconds | Completion rate |
| YouTube Long | 8-12 minutes | Horizontal | First 30 seconds | Satisfaction + session time |

---

## output format

Deliver the pieces in this structure:

```
## Repurpose Plan — [Source Title]

**Source:** [1-line summary]
**Central takeaway:** [The one idea]
**Channels produced:** [List]

---

### LinkedIn — Slide Deck
[Full content, slide by slide]

### LinkedIn — Written Post
[Full post, ready to paste]

### X — Thread
[Tweet 1]
---
[Tweet 2]
---
[etc.]

### X — Standalone Tweets
1. [Tweet]
2. [Tweet]
3. [Tweet]

### Instagram — Slide Deck
[Full content, slide by slide + caption]

### Instagram — Reel Script
[30-second script with timing marks]

### TikTok — Script
[Script with timing marks + production notes]

### YouTube Short — Script
[Script with timing marks]
```

If any piece needs real input the user hasn't provided (specific testimonial name, real number, current launch URL), mark `[PLACEHOLDER — needs real X]` so they can see exactly what to fill in. Never fabricate.

---

## gotchas

The failure modes that kill performance:

1. **Copy-pasting across channels.** Every channel has different norms. Cross-posted content performs 40-60% worse than channel-native.
2. **Recycling the same scroll-stopper everywhere.** LinkedIn openers and TikTok openers need completely different energy and format.
3. **Skipping channel-native features.** No hashtags on LinkedIn slide decks. Always add captions on video. Instagram demands visual-first thinking.
4. **Dumping everything at once.** Stagger across days and weeks. Each piece needs room to perform.
5. **Leaving off the call to action.** Every piece needs a clear next step, but channel-appropriate (LinkedIn: "Save / Repost / Follow", X: "Follow + RT tweet 1", Instagram: "Send to someone who needs this").
6. **Voice drift by channel.** The energy shifts per channel, but the USER's core voice must hold. If LinkedIn sounds like corporate-you and TikTok sounds like someone else entirely, that's AI-tell, not adaptation.
7. **Too many ideas per piece.** One post = one idea. Don't cram the whole source into one slide deck. Use the multiplier — extract one building block per piece.
8. **Fabricating specifics.** Don't invent testimonials, names, numbers, or case studies not present in the source. Use `[PLACEHOLDER]`.
9. **Ignoring the user's ICP's channel mix.** If their ICP is on LinkedIn and X but not TikTok, don't generate a TikTok script. Match output to audience.
10. **Hashtag maximalism.** LinkedIn: 3-5 max, at the bottom with a line break. Instagram: 3 niche tags (avoid the generic 30). X: sparingly, if at all. Hashtags are dead weight on the wrong channel.

---

## the test

Good repurposing passes six tests before shipping:

1. **Standalone** — each piece makes sense without the source.
2. **Native** — it doesn't feel "repurposed" (reads like it was built for that channel).
3. **Right hook** — the scroll-stopper matches the channel's energy.
4. **Front-loaded** — best material comes first (especially in video).
5. **Clear next step** — call to action fits the channel.
6. **Voice match** — compare one piece against the user's voice samples. Rhythm + word choice match.

**Failure condition:** If a competitor could post the same piece word-for-word with their name swapped in — it failed. The voice is thin. Re-pull voice samples from context and rewrite.

Run `antislop` on every piece before delivery. Final gate, non-negotiable.

---

## connector actions

After delivering all platform variants, ask before taking any of the following steps — never act without explicit confirmation:

- **`~~chat`** — Post the variants to a Slack channel for team review before scheduling. Ask: which channel?
- **`~~cloud-storage`** — Save the full repurposed set to Google Drive. Ask: which folder?

Prompt: "Should I send these to Slack for review, save them to Drive, or keep them here for now?"

## how this connects to other skills

**Runs before this skill (sources to repurpose):**
- `newsletter` — newsletter editions become multi-channel posts
- `landing-page` — landing page insights (proof, offer, testimonials) distribute across channels
- `x-article` — X articles become LinkedIn, newsletter, thread variants
- `x-longform-tweet` — long-form tweets seed the thread/carousel version
- `linkedin-post` — one LinkedIn post atomizes into thread, IG, YouTube short

**Runs after this skill (polish):**
- `antislop` — mandatory final pass on every channel piece
- `editing` — optional second polish for long-form YouTube scripts

**Adjacent:**
- `keyword-research` — identifies which topics to repurpose based on search demand
- `business-interview` — populates voice + ICP context so repurposing stays on-brand
