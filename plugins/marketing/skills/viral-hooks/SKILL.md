Use when writing a hook, opening a thread, punching up a post opener, or when an existing post isn't getting engagement. Triggers on: write a hook, give me a hook, write the opening line, punch up this opener, hook for X/Twitter, thread opener, LinkedIn hook, make this go viral, stop the scroll. Pulls from a daily-updated swipefile (Greg Isenberg, Dan Koe, Nikita Bier, Alex Prompter, Matt Shumer, Mario Nawfal, Andrej Karpathy, Pieter Levels, and ~50 others). Outputs 3-5 hook variations across different patterns so the user can pick."

# Viral Hooks

Most hooks fail because writers reach for what feels clever instead of what actually stops the scroll. The result: "Let me tell you about..." openers, rhetorical questions that answer themselves, and polished corporate buildup that screams AI.

The hooks that actually break through are built from patterns — specific structural moves used by creators who hit 100k+ views consistently. This skill pulls from a library of 140+ of those patterns, matches them to the content at hand, and produces 3-5 variations so the user can pick.

The hook has one job: stop the scroll in under 2 seconds and earn the "show more" click. Never sacrifice the body of the post for a flashy hook.

---

## the core job

Turn a topic, angle, or rough draft into 3-5 hook options, each using a different proven pattern from the swipefile. Each hook comes with the pattern name and a one-line note on when that pattern works best.

**Output format:** 3-5 hook variations, each labeled with the pattern used and a brief "use this if..." note. Includes a recommendation for the strongest option.

---

## before starting: gather context

**STOP. Do not write any hooks until every field below is confirmed with the user. Ask for any missing field before proceeding. Even if the user pasted a draft or topic, still confirm these inputs.**

**Load reference skills first:**
- `company-instructions` — Solecooler voice rules, writing standards, and banned phrases that apply to all output.

1. **Topic / source material** — What's the post about? Paste the topic, the draft, the argument, or a URL. (Required — without this there's nothing to hook.)
2. **The angle** — What's the specific take or argument? Not "AI" — "why most AI SDRs will fail in 2026". (Required — generic angles get generic hooks.)
3. **Audience** — Who's this for? Founders? Marketers? Designers? (Shapes which patterns hit.)
4. **Content type** — How-to, critique, case study, data breakdown, prediction, cultural commentary, or something else? (Maps to pattern families — see step 2.)
5. **Emotional goal** — What should the reader feel in 2 seconds? Shock, intrigue, FOMO, discovery, authority envy, validation? (Narrows to 2-3 pattern families.)

Optional: if the user has a voice guide or past successful hooks, pull those in as style anchors.

---

## step 1: read the pattern library

Before writing, open [examples/hooks.md](examples/hooks.md). This is the source of truth — 140+ categorized patterns with real examples, templates, and "use when" guidance.

**Do not invent patterns that aren't in the library.** The patterns work because real creators tested them in public. Made-up patterns are slop in disguise.

Skim for patterns that match the content type and emotional goal from context step 3-5.

---

## step 2: match to pattern families

Pick candidate patterns by two dimensions:

### Content type → pattern family

| Content type | Pattern family |
|--------------|----------------|
| How-to / tactical | Numbered List Promise, Workflow Reveal, Stack/Setup Breakdown |
| Profile / biography | Authority Figure Introduction, "This is [NAME]" |
| Critique / takedown | Contrarian ("X is a scam"), Pattern Break, Reversal |
| Case study / business story | Dramatic Business Narrative, "Everyone laughed. Then..." |
| Data-driven | Shocking Statistic Lead, Counterintuitive Number |
| Market analysis | Trend Call-Out, Industry Shift, "The [Category] is Dying" |
| Cultural commentary | Observation Hook, "Notice how..." |
| Prediction / thesis | Bold Claim, Timeline Forecast |

### Emotional goal → pattern family

| Goal | Pattern family |
|------|----------------|
| Shock | Shocking Statistic Lead, Dollar-Amount Drama |
| Intrigue | Mystery Question, Paradox Setup |
| FOMO | Missed-Opportunity Reveal, "Everyone Thinks X" Reversal |
| Discovery | "Most Overlooked" Superlative, Hidden-Gem Reveal |
| Authority envy | Name-Drop Stack, Achievement Ladder |
| Validation | "What I Actually Think" Candor, Contrarian Confession |

Anti-pattern: forcing one pattern into every post. Match the pattern to the content, not the other way around.

---

## step 3: draft 3-5 variations

Pull the specific pattern from `examples/hooks.md`, not the high-level family. Each entry in the library has a template and a real example — adapt the template to the user's angle.

For each variation:
- Use a different pattern
- Adapt the template language, don't copy it
- Keep the hook under 280 characters for single-tweet feel (longer if explicitly writing a long-form post)
- End with a thread indicator (🧵, "Here's the full story:", "A thread...") if this opens a thread

Write 3 minimum, 5 maximum. More than 5 becomes noise.

---

## step 4: pressure-test every draft

Run each hook through this checklist. If it fails any, rewrite:

- Stops the scroll in under 2 seconds
- Creates specific curiosity (not vague interest)
- Makes a bold but defensible claim
- Uses concrete numbers, names, or details — no abstractions
- Promises clear value in the body
- Matches a specific pattern from the library
- First sentence is the strongest sentence
- Passes the "so what?" test
- Zero filler words or throat-clearing
- No hedge words ("might", "perhaps", "arguably")

### Anti-patterns — never ship these

- "Let me tell you about..."
- "I want to share..."
- "Today I'm going to explain..."
- Apologizing or hedging openers
- Burying the lede past sentence one
- Generic superlatives without specifics
- Rhetorical questions the hook already answers
- Overpromising what the body delivers

### Voice rules (when the user has a voice guide)

Always check the user's voice guide before finalizing. For Ole Lehmann specifically:

**Never:** "Not X, it's Y" constructions, "No X. No Y. Just Z." rule-of-three, short rhetorical questions as transitions, one-word sentences, dropping "I" as a subject, polished corporate buildup.

**Always:** specific details, casual interjections, dry humor, varied sentence lengths, lowercase headers, bold unhedged statements.

---

## step 5: recommend the strongest option

After the 3-5 drafts, name the one that fits best and say why in one sentence. Don't hedge — pick a winner. Users want a verdict, not a menu.

---

## output format

```
**3-5 HOOK VARIATIONS**

### Option 1 — [Pattern Name]
[Hook copy]
*Use this if: [one-line condition where this version wins]*

### Option 2 — [Pattern Name]
[Hook copy]
*Use this if: [one-line condition]*

[... up to 5 options]

---

**Recommended:** Option [N]. [One sentence on why this pattern fits the topic and audience best.]
```

---

## enhancement techniques (optional plays)

### Pattern stacking — combine two patterns for more punch
- Shocking Stat + Authority: "~40% of cancer deaths could be prevented if caught at Stage 1. So Peter Attia and Silicon Valley's elite just built the solution."
- Contrarian + Mystery: "Shampoo is a scam. Here's how you can improve hair thickness without exposing yourself to hormone-disrupting chemicals."

### Visual formatting
- ALL CAPS for product/tool names ("NATTOKINASE", "CLAUDE CODE")
- Short punchy sentences on their own lines
- Strategic white space — each sentence earns its line

### Curiosity-gap phrases
- "Here's the shocking truth:"
- "What I found is mind-blowing:"
- "The disturbing truth about..."
- "Here's what nobody is talking about:"
- "Everyone missed this:"

### Callback hooks — reference prior viral content
- "Remember that thread on [topic]? Here's what happened next."
- "Everyone loved my thread on [X]. I left out the most important part."

## how this connects to other skills

**Feeds into this skill:**
- **/interesting** — if the angle isn't sharp yet, run that first to generate 3-5 sharper angles, then bring the chosen angle here as input.
- **/vibe2-brand-voice** or user's voice guide — if a voice file exists, the hook should match the user's tone.

**This skill feeds into:**
- **/x-longform-tweet** — the hook opens the long-form post. That skill writes the body using 9 structural patterns.
- **/linkedin-post** — for LinkedIn-specific hooks, the patterns carry over but posting format differs slightly.
- **/linkedin-comment** — the same hook patterns sharpen a comment's first line (the part above the "…more" cutoff).
- **/x-article** — for long-form X articles, the hook is still the scroll-stopper.
- **/antislop** — mandatory final pass on any hook before posting.

## the test

A good hook:

1. **Stops the scroll in under 2 seconds** — first sentence earns the next line. If a reader has to think to understand what the post is about, it failed.
2. **Uses a specific pattern from the library** — not invented, not generic. If the pattern doesn't exist in `examples/hooks.md`, rewrite.
3. **Includes concrete details** — names, numbers, or specifics. "Many people" fails. "6,500 people" passes.
4. **Makes a bold, defensible claim** — the body must back it up. Overpromising burns trust faster than an average hook with a great body.
5. **Skips filler openers** — no "Let me tell you", "I want to share", rhetorical questions that answer themselves, or corporate buildup.
6. **Fits the user's voice** — if a voice guide exists, the hook passes it. If the user is Ole Lehmann, no em-dash rule-of-three moves, no "not X, it's Y".
7. **Comes with a recommendation** — 3-5 options plus a pick. Users came for a verdict, not a menu.

If the hook could open any post on any topic — it failed. The hook must feel specific to this topic, this angle, this audience.
